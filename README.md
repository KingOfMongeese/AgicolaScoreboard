# AgicolaScoreboard
A basic score board to be used with the Agricola board game. This is NOT affiliated with the Agricola Board game. Just a side project and a way to test my UI building skills. 

Run setup.py to install required models. Tested on Windows and Ubuntu.

```$ python3 setup.py```

Or you can install the first release for Windows!
